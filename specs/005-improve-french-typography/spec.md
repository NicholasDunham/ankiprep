# Feature Specification: Improve French Typography NNBSP Handling

**Feature Branch**: `005-improve-french-typography`  
**Created**: September 26, 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Currently, if the vocabulary cards already use narrow non-breaking spaces (NNBSP) inside angled quotes, AnkiPrep still adds them again. This is unnecessary. Improve French typography handling to avoid duplicate NNBSP insertion for quotes and punctuation marks."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí Feature clearly defined: Fix duplicate NNBSP insertion
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Actors: AnkiPrep users with French vocabulary cards
   ‚Üí Actions: Typography processing, NNBSP insertion/replacement
   ‚Üí Data: Text content with French punctuation and quotes
   ‚Üí Constraints: Follow French typography rules, avoid duplicates
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí All scenarios clearly specified by user
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí User flow: Process French text with proper spacing
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement testable and specific
6. Identify Key Entities
   ‚Üí Text content, punctuation marks, spacing characters
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-09-26
- Q: Should AnkiPrep fall back to custom implementation or skip French typography processing when no suitable library exists? ‚Üí A: Fall back to custom implementation maintaining current behavior (decision made at development time, not runtime)
- Q: Which specific Unicode characters should be treated as full-width spaces versus standard spaces? ‚Üí A: Both refer to regular space (U+0020)
- Q: Should typography rules apply to entire text or only to specifically identified French portions? ‚Üí A: Apply French typography rules to entire text content

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
As a French language learner using AnkiPrep to process vocabulary cards, I want the typography processing to intelligently handle existing narrow non-breaking spaces (NNBSP) so that my cards follow proper French punctuation rules without unnecessary duplication of spacing characters.

### Acceptance Scenarios

#### Angled Quotation Marks (¬´ ¬ª)
1. **Given** text with angled quotes containing no spaces (e.g., ¬´bonjour¬ª), **When** AnkiPrep processes the text, **Then** it adds NNBSPs after opening and before closing quotes (¬´ bonjour ¬ª)

2. **Given** text with angled quotes containing regular spaces (e.g., ¬´ bonjour ¬ª), **When** AnkiPrep processes the text, **Then** it replaces regular spaces with NNBSPs (¬´ bonjour ¬ª)

3. **Given** text with angled quotes already containing NNBSPs (e.g., ¬´ bonjour ¬ª), **When** AnkiPrep processes the text, **Then** it leaves the spacing unchanged

#### Double Punctuation Marks (:, ;, !, ?)
1. **Given** text with double punctuation marks with no preceding space (e.g., "Bonjour:"), **When** AnkiPrep processes the text, **Then** it adds a NNBSP before the punctuation mark ("Bonjour :")

2. **Given** text with double punctuation marks with regular spaces (e.g., "Bonjour :"), **When** AnkiPrep processes the text, **Then** it replaces the regular space with a NNBSP ("Bonjour :")

3. **Given** text with double punctuation marks already having NNBSPs (e.g., "Bonjour :"), **When** AnkiPrep processes the text, **Then** it leaves the spacing unchanged

### Edge Cases
- What happens when text contains mixed spacing types within the same document?
- How does the system handle nested quotations with different spacing?
- What occurs when punctuation marks appear at the beginning or end of lines?

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST detect existing narrow non-breaking spaces (NNBSP) in French text before applying typography rules
- **FR-002**: System MUST add NNBSPs after opening angled quotes (¬´) and before closing angled quotes (¬ª) when no spacing exists
- **FR-003**: System MUST replace regular spaces with NNBSPs around angled quotation marks
- **FR-004**: System MUST preserve existing NNBSPs around angled quotation marks without duplication
- **FR-005**: System MUST add NNBSPs before French double punctuation marks (:, ;, !, ?) when no space exists
- **FR-006**: System MUST replace regular spaces with NNBSPs before French double punctuation marks
- **FR-007**: System MUST preserve existing NNBSPs before French double punctuation marks without duplication
- **FR-008**: System MUST maintain compliance with standard French typography and punctuation rules
- **FR-009**: System MUST process text without changing the overall structure or complexity of the codebase
- **FR-010**: System MUST use existing or battle-tested typography libraries when available; if none exist, MUST fall back to custom implementation that maintains current behavior (library selection decision made at development time)
- **FR-011**: System MUST apply French typography rules to all text content (language-specific processing for mixed content to be addressed in future feature)

### Key Entities
- **Text Content**: The input text containing French vocabulary and phrases that require typography processing
- **Punctuation Marks**: French double punctuation characters (:, ;, !, ?) that require preceding NNBSP
- **Quotation Marks**: Angled French quotes (¬´ ¬ª) that require internal NNBSP spacing
- **Spacing Characters**: Various space types including regular spaces (U+0020) and narrow non-breaking spaces (NNBSP/U+202F)
