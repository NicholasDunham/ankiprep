# Feature Specification: Simplify and De-engineer Codebase

**Feature Branch**: `004-simplify-and-de`  
**Created**: September 25, 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Simplify and de-engineer the ankiprep codebase while preserving all existing CLI functionality and features"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   → Identified: simplification and de-engineering task
2. Extract key concepts from description
   → Actors: developer/maintainer
   → Actions: simplify, reduce complexity, remove over-engineering
   → Data: existing codebase structure
   → Constraints: preserve all CLI functionality and features
3. No unclear aspects identified - user provided clear constraints
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   → Clear user flow: maintain functionality while reducing complexity
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   → Each requirement focused on code quality improvements
6. No new entities involved - working with existing codebase
7. Run Review Checklist
   → No clarifications needed
   → No implementation details in requirements
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-09-25

- Q: What specifically constitutes over-engineering in this context? → A: All of the above patterns that add maintenance overhead
- Q: How will you validate that simplification was successful while ensuring no functional regression occurred? → A: Combination of test validation, output comparison, and complexity metrics
- Q: What constraints should guide which parts of the codebase can be modified during simplification? → A: Any code that doesn't change external behavior or break existing tests
- Q: What approach should be used for the refactoring process to minimize risk? → A: Incremental changes with tests running after each small modification

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story

As a developer maintaining a personal CLI tool, I want to simplify the codebase architecture while preserving all existing functionality, so that the application remains easier to understand, maintain, and modify without losing any features that users depend on.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** the current ankiprep CLI tool with all its features, **When** the codebase is simplified, **Then** all existing CLI commands and flags continue to work exactly as documented in README.md
2. **Given** the over-engineered current structure, **When** unnecessary complexity is removed, **Then** the codebase becomes more maintainable while producing identical output
3. **Given** the existing test suite, **When** code is simplified, **Then** all tests continue to pass without modification to test expectations
4. **Given** users relying on the current CLI interface, **When** refactoring is complete, **Then** no breaking changes are introduced to the user experience

### Edge Cases

- What happens when complex internal structures are simplified but edge cases in CSV processing must still be handled?
- How does the system ensure no regression in French typography processing during simplification?
- What happens if duplicate detection logic is simplified but must maintain exact same behavior?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST preserve all existing CLI commands and flags exactly as documented in README.md
- **FR-002**: System MUST maintain identical output for all input scenarios after refactoring
- **FR-003**: System MUST continue to handle CSV and TSV file processing with same accuracy
- **FR-004**: System MUST retain French typography formatting capability with no changes to behavior
- **FR-005**: System MUST preserve smart quotes conversion functionality
- **FR-006**: System MUST maintain duplicate detection and removal capabilities
- **FR-007**: System MUST continue memory monitoring for large files
- **FR-008**: System MUST reduce code complexity by eliminating over-engineering (excessive abstraction layers, comprehensive testing/linting infrastructure for single-user tool, complex file organization that obscures core logic)
- **FR-009**: System MUST remove unnecessary architectural layers while maintaining functionality
- **FR-010**: System MUST eliminate duplicated code and consolidate similar functionality
- **FR-011**: System MUST remove unnecessary configuration files and tooling that add maintenance overhead for single-user application
- **FR-012**: System MUST maintain UTF-8 encoding support and file format compatibility
- **FR-013**: System MUST validate successful simplification through combination of test validation, automated output comparison with sample files, and measurable code complexity metric reduction
- **FR-014**: System MUST constrain modifications to code that doesn't change external behavior or break existing tests
- **FR-015**: System MUST use incremental refactoring approach with tests running after each small modification to minimize risk

### Key Entities

- **CLI Interface**: The command-line interface that users interact with, including all flags and options
- **File Processor**: The core functionality that transforms input CSV/TSV files into Anki-compatible format
- **Typography Engine**: The component handling French punctuation and smart quotes formatting
- **Duplicate Detector**: The logic for identifying and removing duplicate entries
- **Output Generator**: The component responsible for creating properly formatted output files
