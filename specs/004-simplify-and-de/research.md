# Research: Simplify and De-engineer Codebase

## Code Complexity Assessment

### Decision: Focus on eliminating over-engineering patterns while preserving functionality

**Rationale**: Based on feature specification clarifications, over-engineering consists of:
- Excessive abstraction layers for simple operations
- Comprehensive testing/linting infrastructure for single-user tool
- Complex file organization that obscures core logic

**Alternatives considered**: 
- Complete rewrite: Rejected due to high risk and time investment
- Gradual evolution: Rejected as it may not achieve significant simplification
- Incremental targeted removal: Selected for risk mitigation and clear progress tracking

## Refactoring Approach Research

### Decision: Incremental changes with continuous test validation

**Rationale**: Minimizes risk of regression while allowing for measurable progress. Each change can be validated immediately against existing test suite and CLI behavior.

**Alternatives considered**:
- Complete rewrite in parallel: Too risky for hobby project maintenance
- Phase-based complete restructure: Higher risk of breaking dependencies
- File-by-file replacement: May miss interconnected simplifications

## Validation Strategy Research

### Decision: Triple validation approach (tests + output comparison + complexity metrics)

**Rationale**: Ensures no functional regression while providing measurable success criteria:
- Test validation: Confirms behavioral correctness
- Output comparison: Validates identical results with sample files  
- Complexity metrics: Provides quantitative measure of simplification success

**Alternatives considered**:
- Tests only: Insufficient to guarantee identical output behavior
- Manual validation only: Not scalable and error-prone
- Metrics only: Doesn't guarantee functionality preservation

## Go Best Practices for Simplification

### Decision: Apply standard Go idioms to reduce complexity

**Rationale**: Go's philosophy emphasizes simplicity and clarity. Standard patterns include:
- Prefer composition over complex inheritance patterns
- Use standard library over external dependencies where possible
- Keep package structure flat and purpose-driven
- Minimize interface proliferation for single-user applications

**Alternatives considered**:
- Maintain current complex structure: Violates simplification goals
- Adopt more complex patterns: Contrary to Go philosophy and project needs

## Single-User CLI Tool Patterns

### Decision: Remove enterprise patterns inappropriate for single-user tools

**Rationale**: Many patterns in the current codebase are designed for multi-user, distributed, or enterprise scenarios that don't apply to a personal CLI tool:
- Excessive configuration layers
- Complex dependency injection for simple operations
- Over-abstracted error handling
- Unnecessary monitoring and metrics for local tools

**Alternatives considered**:
- Keep all enterprise patterns: Adds maintenance overhead without benefit
- Selective retention: Creates inconsistency and partial complexity
