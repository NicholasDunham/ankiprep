# Feature Specification: Cloze Deletion Colon Exception

**Feature Branch**: `002-i-ve-found`  
**Created**: September 24, 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "I've found a bug. I use a lot of cloze deletion cards in Anki. Cloze deletions follow the format {{c1::target word::optional hint}}. An example CSV file for cloze cards is in #file:Pending Flashcards - Cloze.csv. The problem is that cloze deletions are an exception to the rule about colons always being preceded by a Narrow Non-Breaking Space (NNBSP) in French. For our purposes, it would be safe to say that inside of a cloze deletion block (double curly braces: {{}}), colons should not be preceded by a NNBSP. All other rules can still apply inside of a cloze deletion block. Only the colon rule should be ignored."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí Found: Bug report with specific typography exception rule
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Actors: Users creating French Anki cards with cloze deletions
   ‚Üí Actions: Processing French text with cloze deletion formatting
   ‚Üí Data: CSV files containing Anki cards with {{c#::text::hint}} format
   ‚Üí Constraints: Colons within cloze deletion blocks must NOT have NNBSP
3. For each unclear aspect: None identified
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí Clear user flow: Processing CSV files with cloze deletions
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement is testable with example text inputs
6. Identify Key Entities: CSV text content, cloze deletion blocks
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers needed
   ‚Üí No implementation details included
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-09-24
- Q: For malformed cloze deletion blocks (like `{{c1::text` missing closing `}}`), what should the system do? ‚Üí A: Log warning but continue processing as if no cloze blocks exist in that field
- Q: For multiple cloze deletions in the same field (like `{{c1::word1}} and {{c2::word2}}`), should the system process them? ‚Üí A: Process each cloze block independently (apply colon exception to both)
- Q: For nested formatting within cloze blocks (like `{{c1::phrase with ¬´ quoted text : example ¬ª}}`), how should the colon rule apply? ‚Üí A: Only skip NNBSP for cloze syntax colons (::), but add NNBSP for other colons inside the content
- Q: Should the system provide any performance expectations for processing CSV files with cloze deletions? ‚Üí A: No
- Q: What level of logging detail should the system provide for cloze deletion processing? ‚Üí A: Only log warnings for malformed cloze blocks

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
As a user creating French Anki flashcards with cloze deletions, I need the French typography processing to correctly handle colons within cloze deletion blocks by NOT adding Narrow Non-Breaking Spaces before them, while still applying all other French typography rules both inside and outside the cloze deletion blocks.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a CSV file containing French text with cloze deletions like `{{c1::essayer}}`, **When** the tool processes the file with French typography enabled, **Then** the colons within the cloze deletion syntax remain unchanged (no NNBSP added)
2. **Given** a CSV file containing French text with both cloze deletions and regular colons like `¬´ essayer ¬ª : tester`, **When** the tool processes the file, **Then** colons outside cloze blocks get NNBSP while colons inside cloze blocks do not
3. **Given** a CSV file with complex cloze deletions like `{{c1::target word::optional hint}}`, **When** processed, **Then** both colons within the cloze block remain without NNBSP
4. **Given** a CSV file with nested content like `{{c1::phrase with ¬´ quoted text : example ¬ª}}`, **When** processed, **Then** the colon inside the quoted text within the cloze block does not get NNBSP

### Edge Cases

- **Malformed cloze deletion blocks**: System logs warning and processes field as regular French text (applies all typography rules including colon NNBSP)
- **Multiple cloze deletions in same field**: System processes each cloze block independently, applying colon exception to all valid blocks
- **Nested formatting within cloze blocks**: System applies NNBSP only to cloze syntax colons (::), while other colons inside the content receive normal French typography treatment

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST identify cloze deletion blocks using the pattern `{{c#::...}}` where # is a number
- **FR-002**: System MUST NOT add Narrow Non-Breaking Spaces before cloze syntax colons (::) that appear within cloze deletion blocks
- **FR-003**: System MUST continue to apply all French typography rules (including colon NNBSP) to content colons within cloze deletion blocks that are not part of the cloze syntax
- **FR-004**: System MUST continue to add NNBSP before colons that appear outside of cloze deletion blocks when French typography is enabled
- **FR-005**: System MUST handle cloze deletion blocks that contain hint text (format: `{{c#::target::hint}}`)
- **FR-006**: System MUST preserve the exact structure and content of cloze deletion syntax while applying typography rules to the content within
- **FR-007**: System MUST log warning messages for malformed cloze deletion blocks and process the field as regular French text (applying all typography rules including colon NNBSP)
- **FR-008**: System MUST process multiple cloze deletion blocks within the same field independently, applying the colon exception rule to each valid block
- **FR-009**: System MUST distinguish between cloze syntax colons (::) and content colons when applying typography rules within cloze deletion blocks

### Key Entities
- **Cloze Deletion Block**: Text enclosed in double curly braces following the pattern `{{c#::content}}` or `{{c#::content::hint}}` where content may contain French text requiring typography processing
- **CSV Text Content**: Fields within CSV files that may contain both regular French text and cloze deletion blocks requiring different colon handling rules
